SQL Bug Fixing: Fix the QUERY - Totaling

Oh no! Timmys been moved into the database divison of his software company but as we know Timmy loves making mistakes. Help Timmy keep his job by fixing his query...

Timmy works for a statistical analysis company and has been given a task of totaling the number of sales on a given day grouped by each department name and then each day.

Resultant table:
day (type: date) {group by} [order by asc]
department (type: text) {group by} [In a real world situation it is bad practice to name a column after a table]
sale_count (type: int)

<ad img here>

```
SELECT 
  CAST(s.transaction_date AS DATE) AS day,
  d.name as department,
  CAST(COUNT(p.price) AS INT) AS sale_count
FROM department d  
  JOIN sale s ON d.id = s.department_id
  JOIN product p ON s.product_id = p.id
  GROUP BY d.name, day
  ORDER BY day ASC
  ```
